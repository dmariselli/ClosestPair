Finds the closest pair of a set of points in the 2-D plane.

The input may be arbitrarily large, up to the limits of physical memory.
The input must be read from standard input where the first line contains the number of points in the input and each subsequent line contains the x-coordinate of a point followed by the y-coordinate, separated by a single space.
Algorithm fits into the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
Running time is T(n·logn) where n is the number of points.
Assumes that the points in the input are distinct.
